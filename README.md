COEN 10: Introduction to Programming

Santa Clara University, Dr. Angela Musurlian, Fall 2019

This includes various C programs from the lab section of this course. The first 4 labs were strictly concept-based and have been omitted

Lab 5 - Multiplication Game (Scan/Print): The game gives two random numbers which the user then multiplies. The game then checks the user's answer and outputs the result. This repeats 10 times and gives the user a percentage score at the end.

Lab 6 - Scheduling System (Loops): Schedule one day of ski lessons for an instructor that gives 1-hour lessons between 1pm to 5pm. The user can request a lesson, cancel a lesson, list the schedule, or quit.

Lab 7 - Ski Lessons (Arrays): Building on the previous lab, the user can now request lessons by name, cancelling lessons now shifts later lessons to earlier times, and the user can now show names who are in the schedule that start with a certain letter.

Lab 8 - Ski Lessons (Functions): Building on the previous lab, the user may not repeat names in the schedule, phone numbers are now kept, and each lesson can be scheduled for 1 to 4 people. This lab also introduces the use of functions.

Lab 9 - Word Manipulation (Strings): This program reads words from the keyboard, places them into a string array, and performs some tasks. The tasks include sorting the words in alphabetical order, reversing the string, converting the letters to uppercase or lowercase, and showing info about the inputted words (longest/shortest words, average word length, words starting with something other than a alphabetical character).

Lab 10 - Ski Lessons (Pointers): Building on Lab 8, the user can now set priorities for the schedule and count the occurrence of a certain letter in all of the names in the schedule.
